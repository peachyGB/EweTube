We treated him for scald and then set him up in the barn to recuperate.  To make him more comfortable,  I decided to treat him to a spa day as well which involved hand shearing him with scissors!",

      "description": " Parasite resistant sheep are king on building a profitable grazing operation. No other farm animal can measure up to the low cost of raising a parasite resistant sheep flock. No inputs required except mineral and a guard dog to protect them. When an animal can average twins each year on pasture, that is an unfair advantage to your benefit while growing your flock. If you want to keep your farm profitable every year, check out my 3 grazing books that I wrote on our website: http://greenpasturesfarm.net/books/",

It is one of two narrow branches at the north end of Cook Inlet, the other being Knik Arm. The Seward Highway follows a portion of the southern edge of the Chugach State Park along Turnagain Arm. Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy. These tides, which can reach 40 feet and come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as a bore tide. The Seward Highway stretches 125 miles from Seward to Anchorage. Life Magazine named this stretch of road one of the most beautiful scenic drives in the world.",
